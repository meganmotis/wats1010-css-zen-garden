My design concept: An actual zen garden

While looking through many of the CSS Zen Garden designs published on the web, I realized how disappointed that so many of the designs 
strayed so far away from the actual concept of a "zen garden." I didn't feel as though many of the designs fit well with the title.

Many of the designs felt to me like they embodied the antithesis of a zen garden: too busy or frantic even, wild or bright color schemes,
images/elements of man-made objects (like a city landscape, robots) did not evoke the quiet, clean, peaceful, natural, contemplative space
of a zen garden.

So for my design, I wanted to try to evoke the light, calm, soothing peace of an actual zen garden. I want to have clean lines, more white space,
muted natural colors (such as green, blue, gray, light brown), images of rocks, sand, garden greenery, maybe a Buddha statue (given that 
the concept of "zen" comes from Buddhism).

Some designs where I drew inspiration:

I liked the three column format, the white space and I like how to text scrolls over the background which stays stationary.

I liked the use of white space, and lightness in the font and color scheme.

I liked this design because it definitely evoked a sense of peace and lightness. The color choice might be a bit too light actually because it's 
a bit difficult to read.

This is a Dave Shea design, the creator of the CSS Zen Garden project, and my favorite because I feel like it actually, more than any other
design I saw, evoked the feeling of a zen garden. I like the color scheme, the simplicity, the white space, the font size and line height.
